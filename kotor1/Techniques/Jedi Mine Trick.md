## Description

A Jedi Mine Trick (or JMT) is a method of interrupting a conversation after it has begun using the completion of the mine-laying animation.  It is most useful in the No Major Glitches ruleset, as the Anywhere Menu Glitch obsoletes it in Unrestricted speedruns.

## How To

A Jedi Mine Trick is really just an [Open Buffer](<Save Buffering#open-buffers>) that ends by laying a mine.  The cutscene or conversation will trigger and run until the mine-laying process is complete, at which point you regain control of your character and the cutscene ends.

### Restrictions

A JMT will not work if the cutscene in question has scripted movement of the character laying the mine at the start, since that scripted movement interrupts the mine-laying animation before it can complete.  Also, a JMT requires the character to have at least 1 point in Demolitions and an available mine to lay.

## Uses

The main benefit of a Jedi Mine Trick over a standard [Save Buffer](<Save Buffering>) is that the conversation or cutscene you're skipping actually begins first, meaning any flags that are set at the start of the conversation will remain set.  Thus any cutscene where a [Save Buffer](<Save Buffering>) would skip important flags can instead be skipped with a JMT.

Current uses in [Any% NMG](./Route%20Guides/Any%25%20NMG) include:
- Skipping three Star Map cutscenes
- Skipping being sent to your room by Uthar after earning enough prestige
