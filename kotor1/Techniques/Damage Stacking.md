## Description

Damage Stacking is one of several methods for duplicating the item properties of a piece of a equipment, most commonly a weapon.  The effect can be repeated to stack multiple copies of the desired item properties.  The effect lasts until a module is loaded, either through exiting the current module or through QS/QL.

The exact methods for Damage Stacking depend on the type of equipment to be stacked.  Each method has a particular setup, but most start from using a [menu-duped piece of equipment](<Item Duplication#menu-duping>).

## One-Handed Weapons

For this method, you need two party members each equipped with a copy of the Stacking Weapon in their mainhand, with no other weapon equipped.  You also need at least one other one-handed weapon that is initially unequipped.  Then, to Damage Stack onto the active party member, follow these steps:

1. Open the mainhand weapon menu, highlight None, then press Previous Menu and Next Menu (henceforth called cycling menus).
2. Swap to your other party member, open the **offhand** weapon menu, select the weapon you are stacking, and cycle menus.
3. Swap to your original party member, open the offhand weapon menu, and immediately press Escape to exit that menu.
4. Swap to your other party member, open the **mainhand** weapon menu, select None and press Enter.
5. Still with your other party member, open the **mainhand** weapon menu again, select a weapon that is **not** the one you're stacking, and press Enter.

*Video forthcoming*

This finishes the damage stack; you should see the effects applied to the original party member's unarmed attack.  If you want to chain damage stacking, make sure to reequip the Stacking Weapon to both party members before repeating the steps above.

## Uses

Damage Stacking is currently used in [All Quests NMG](<../Route Guides/All Quests NMG>) for the duel ring on Taris.  Unrestricted speedruns do not need Damage Stacking thanks to the [Sneak Attack FLU](<../Major Glitches/Fake Level Up#sneak-attack-flu>), while [Any% NMG](<../Route Guides/Any%25 NMG>) currently does not employ damage stacking since the menuing takes too long to be time effective.
