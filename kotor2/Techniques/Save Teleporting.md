## Description

Save Teleporting is a method of movement that employs a Quick Save, and allows you to teleport a variable amount of distance forward.  The distance teleported depends on how long it takes your game to save, which is affected by computer performance and how far into the game you are.

## How To

To save teleport, simply hold both mouse buttons down to run forward, then press the Quick Save button.

*Notes:* 
- You will get more distance from a Save Teleport if Force Speed and Adrenal Alacrity are NOT active.  Sometimes it is better to let these buffs wear off and Save Teleport for movement, particularly later in the run.
- Save Teleports become more effective as you get further into the game.  Generally speaking, they are ineffective on Peragus and Citadel Station, and start to become useful on Telos Surface.  During the late game, they can be quite powerful.
- **Warning!** Save Teleporting into a mine can crash your game.  Be sure to aim your teleports so that they end just before or just after the mine.

## Uses

The main use of Save Teleports is movement; Save Teleporting is eventually the fastest form of movement for all glitched speedruns.  Save Teleporting can also be used to skip over triggers, but usually [Save Buffering](<Save Buffering>) is used for that purpose.
