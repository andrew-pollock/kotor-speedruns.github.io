## Description

A Conversation Queue is a method of using conversations with NPCs or party members to bypass triggers, thereby skipping other conversations or cutscenes.

## How To

To perform a Conversation Queue, click on an NPC or party member that is not adjacent to you, i.e. far enough away that your character has to walk there.  While this conversation is waiting to begin, it is at the front of the trigger queue, and thus other triggers will not be able to fire.  This technique is frequently enhanced by clicking on a party member, then swapping to that party member and running away from the conversation.  This allows you to move somewhat freely with the Conversation Queue active and avoid any triggers you may travel past.

Most hotkeys are disabled during a Conversation Queue, but Default Action can be used to open doors and other non-conversation based objects.  To cancel a Conversation Queue, you can either let the conversation happen, Quick Save and Quick Load, or interact with an object that causes a module transition.

Note that Conversation Queues cannot skip *all* types of triggers; in particular, enemy spawn triggers will still activate, and certain forced cutscenes will as well.

## Uses

One notable benefit of a Conversation Queue is the ability to easily bypass loading zone triggers, even without a party.  While not widely used, a Conversation Queue is also an alternative to [Save Buffering](</kotor2/Techniques/Save Buffering>) in other niche situations.  Currently, Conversation Queues uses include:

1. Enabling [Combat Talking](</kotor2/Techniques/Combat Talking>); this is really just using a conversation queue to delay entering combat until after the desired conversation.

Finally, Conversation Queue is extremely useful on platforms where [Save Buffering](</kotor2/Techniques/Save Buffering>) is not possible, such as console or mobile speedruns.
