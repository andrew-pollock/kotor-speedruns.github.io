## Description

Combat Talking is a method for temporarily canceling combat, allowing you to talk to NPCs even when combat would normally prevent it.  This can allow certain fights to be skipped completely.

## How To

To perform Combat Talking, first stand near the NPC with whom you want to talk.  Quick Save your game, then Quick Load.  As soon as the game loads, pause your game; this pause should happen immediately after the load screen disappears, before the fade-in from black.  Click on the NPC to talk to them, then unpause the game.  Your conversation should begin soon after unpausing.

Combat Talking works because KotOR assumes you aren't in combat when a game is first loaded.  Thus the Quick Save/Quick Load combination effectively cancels combat, and by pausing the game immediately after the Quick Load, you have enough time to talk set up a [Conversation Queue](</kotor2/Techniques/Conversation Queue>) to an NPC or party member before you are attacked again.

## Uses

Combat Talking is mostly used as a backup strategy when other methods fail. Max Quests Unresticted uses a few:
