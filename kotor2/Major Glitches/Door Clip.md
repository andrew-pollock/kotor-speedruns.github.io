[center][big]***Door Clipping
----------------------------***[/big][/center]

[section=Description]
Door clipping in KotOR 2 is significantly more robust than in KotOR 1. By simply adding and removing party members while adjacent to a wall or door with proper positioning. A party member can be spawned in behind the door or wall. This allows for several sequence breaks.

[section=How To]
In general these clips are performed as so:
* Add single party member
* Position both PCs such that the spawn-in location of the 3rd PC will be behind the obstacle
* Add the party member
* If they spawn in the correct location you're finished. If not remove the party member and re-add until they do spawn in the correct location. This re-adding process may have to be done rapidly.

[section=Uses]
The number of use-cases in unrestricted routes have diminished significantly due to modern techniques. Though there are still several examples:
