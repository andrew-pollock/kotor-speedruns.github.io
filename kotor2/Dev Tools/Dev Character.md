## Description
***STEAM/ASPYR ONLY***

In KotOR 1 and the legacy versions of KotOR 2, there is no error handling for loading a save where there is no module present for the destination module. For whatever reason, the Steam/Aspyr build does handle this scenario. Whenever you attempt to load into a module that does not exist on the save, this version will happily generate that module, and along with it a new Main Character: The Dev Character.

## How To
There are two ways the dev character can be obtained:

**Saving in a module with the include-in-save flag set to false**
This occurs when by various innocuous means (i.e. an [Anywhere Menu Glitch](../Major%20Glitches/Anywhere%20Menu%20Glitch)) you manage to gain control in a module that doesn't normally get included in the save. Examples include the swoop minigames. By saving in one and then forcing the game to load such a save, the dev character will be acquired, because the game is loading a module with no data.

**Loading a save with incorrect metadata that targets a nonexistent module (Forward [Hotshot](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot))**
This occurs when performing the [Hotshot](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot) glitch to a destination that either hasn't yet been explored by the original save or was deleted from the original save. This could be done in it's most simple form by saving outside of a module that you will be going to for the first time, entering this new module, and then [hotshotting](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot) to this destination (As shown in the below video). This could also be done by saving in a location that will be deleted (such as the damaged Ebon Hawk) and then [hotshotting](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot))back their later in the game.

## Benefits
- **Killblaster:** The Dev Character comes equipped with a blaster that instantly kills any enemy provided they hit them. (NOTE: there is a 5% chance of missing, due to critical fails)
- **Lightsaber:** The Dev Character is equipped with a lightsaber which is useful for efficiently bashing doors/containers and performing force-jumps
- **Force Power Suite:** The Dev Character possesses a suite of force powers including, but not limited to, Force speed, Revitalize, Force Storm, Force Jump, a variety of Buffs, and heal
- **Alignment:** The Dev Character has a lightside score of 70, which makes acquiring a high alignment rather trivial, with this as a starting point. This is useful for alignment heavy routes
- **Passable Stats:** The Dev Character is level 12, with a set of decent combat survivability stats.
- **Skill Suite:** The Dev Character is proficient at every skill except repair, with a bonus greater than 10 in each of them. They are particularly skilled in Treat Injury.
