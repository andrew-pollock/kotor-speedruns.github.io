## Description
During the tutorial Ebon Hawk section of the game (commonly referred to as the prologue), we receive a temporary party member to teach about the Party system: 3C-FD. This character was never intended to be removed from the prologue, and has some interesting properties in other modules.

As it turns out 3C-FD was used during the development of the game to test various features, particularly on Peragus. Many of these test cheats are still enabled on 3C, provided you can acquire him. By using a [Hotshot](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot) from the Prologue we can extricate 3C from the Ebon Hawk, and use him anywhere in the game, for a variety of interesting phenomena. 

## How To
1. Use a previously prepared save to [Hotshot](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot) to the Prologue
2. Following the tutorial to unlock the door to the main hold
3. Collect parts from the destroyed Gonk Droid
4. Enter into the Cargo hold and run up to 3C
5. Repair and add him to the party.
6. [Hotshot](../Major%20Glitches/Hotshot) to the module where he is needed
7. Speak to him to perform whatever trick is needed.
