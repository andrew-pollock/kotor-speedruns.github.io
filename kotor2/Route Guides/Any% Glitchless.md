Glitchless Any% Guide v2.0: Female Jedi Guardian Route[/big]**[/center]

*I want to credit 30cents for his initial route for KOTOR 2 Glitchless.  This would not have been done without his intial work on the route!  I also want to credit ChaosDrifter for helping me with much of the calculations and theory crafting into the category improvements.*

This route defeats Darth Traya on Malachor V as fast as possible without the use of glitches.  Timing begins upon clicking "PLAY" after character creation and ends on the last hit on Traya.  A load-removal tool is available for LiveSplit thanks to glasnonck; times are sorted based on load-removed times, since load times vary significantly in this game, and saving is frequent.  This guide will cover the character build for the run, as well as a detailed route.

If you have additional questions, you can check out the KotOR Speedrunning Discord which is linked on the game's sidebar on speedrun.com.  There's a bunch of friendly folks there willing to answer questions!

[section=Glitchless Rules]

All glitches are banned, with the exception of the following:
- Fast text (unavoidable without restarting the game frequently)
- Duration glitch (also unavoidable, and semirandom at this point in time, though it is less effective in this game than in KOTOR 1)

In addition, exploits that give infinite experience, credits, or alignment points are also banned.

Due to its glitchy nature, QUICKSAVE is banned as well.  Manual and autosaves, however, are allowed.

No mods are allowed to be used (Yes, this also includes the restoration mod!)

[section=General Tips]
- If running on any monitor over 60fps, underclock it to 60 FPS exactly (if not done, your game will randomly hang during combat)
- Unbind your quicksave key!  You can do this by setting the Quicksave key (default F4) to the Quickload Key (default F5) then setting the Quickload key back to F5.
- Learn how to swap abilities easily.  Shift + # swaps the ability.(e.g shift+1 swaps from Critical Strike to Flurry, and shift+4 swaps force powers)
- Watch someone's PB video while going through the notes!  This is very important to fundamentally understand the run and how it flows, and learn possible tricks to make your run much more faster and smoother.
- Manual save a lot (if you are new)!  The game tends to be very wonky, can be prone to crashing in the worse moments, especially if you're on a good run.
- Once you understand the fundamentals from these notes, make your own copy of the notes and modify them to your own use.  These notes are made detailed for a new player, and once you become more experienced you will need less of these notes.
- Remember to have fun!

[section=Character Build]

We begin the game as a Jedi Guardian primarily because of Force Jump, and its combat focued skills.  Female characters are chosen because instead of Handmaiden (which you attain as a Male character), you get Disciple.  Having Handmaiden incurs extra cutscenes with Atris at the end of the game.

Our main character doesn't need any skill investment in anything but TI, as Affect Mind is used for anything requiring persuasion.

**Initial Attributes**

Str - 18
Dex - 14
Con - 14
Int - 8
Wis - 10
Cha - 8

**Initial Skills**

Treat Injury - 4 (You can simply press reccomend and it will allocate all points to Treat Injury automatically)
**Initial Feat** - Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons

We are going to focus on melee attacks with a lightsaber, so we max out Strength immediately, and get enough Dexterity and Constitution to help us survive.  The final two points are put into Wisdom for a slightly better chance resisting Force Powers at the end of the game, as well as a slightly bigger pool.

Treat Injury (TI) will be our main skill, since there are no strict skill requirements we have to meet.

We choose Weapon Focus: Melee Weapons for the attack boost before getting our lightsaber; we pick it over Two-Weapon Fighting because Weapon Focus takes longer to select, so at level 2 it's faster to pick Two-Weapon Fighting.  Since character creation isn't timed, this is optimal.

[section=Leveling Plan]

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/808151224842977353/812840691394674718/unknown.png

You will notice skills and attributes are not listed here.  That is because when leveling up, all skills/attribute points will use Reccomended (Strength/Treat Injury respectively)

Our main combat plan is lots of Strength, Master Two-Weapon Fighting, Master Critical Strike, and Knight Speed, using dual lightsabers.  This gives us attacks that will deal as much damage as possible; we want to hit as hard as possible, since enemies in the later parts of the game will have higher HP. With Juyo Form lategame, doing 180+ damage in the endgame is quite common. 

Other notes:

**Skill notes:** 
- We only use Treat Injury to make our medpac use more efficient.
- Persuade isn't used, as Affect Mind is sufficent enough for all of our needs during the run.

**Feat notes:**
- Weapon Focus: Lightsaber is chosen since there aren't other good feats at level 3, and it gives +1 to attack when we get our lightsaber later.
- Critical Strike and Two-Weapon Fighting are our main combat core.

**Force Power notes:**
- Force Speed is the most important power, giving double movement speed.  With no Save Teleports, this is an essential power for the run.  Knight Speed also grants +1 attack per round, which is highly important due to our relatively low chance to hit.
	- Duration Glitch in this game is not as effective in KOTOR 2, so we will be using much more of it, and we will generally take Kreia into our party as a second source of Force Speed due to the Force Bond ability affecting both our MC and Kreia.
- Force Valor is used to boost stats and saving throws for various combat sections in the game.
- Affect Mind is used in the following places:
1. Affect Mind is required to persuade the receptionist in the Exchange Base to allow you through.
2. Affect Mind persuades the thugs in Nar Shaddaa to jump off the pit (horray!).  This gives us a lot of alignment points to get Visas after the Red Eclipse attack.
- Energy Resistance is not particularly useful, but there aren't any worthwhile Force Powers to get at level 5.  Energy Resistance keeps our menus mostly uncluttered.
- Force Deflection is taken as it's a nice defensive passive skill, and you frequently run through heavy amounts of ranged enemies in the game.
- Battle Meditation is a nice filler, lasts 20 seconds, and provides very good stat boosts for fights provided you have the spare force to use them.
- Force Armor is taken, at late game we get Force Enlightenment and it gains the benefits of Force Speed, Valor, and Force Armor all at once.  Force Armor is delayed as much as possible for easy access to Force Speed.
- Breath Control is attained for free during the Jek Jek Tarr section on Nar Shaddaa.  It makes us immune to poison, but we don't use it in this run at all.

[section=Equipment Plan]

A special note on KOTOR 2 is that many of the drops/containers you loot are randomized.  The base items here are all guarenteed items, but it is possible you may obtain items in your run that are more optimal to equip before getting the guaranteed items listed below (or could possibly be better!).

*Implant: Power Implant*
Bought on Nar Shaddaa from Geeda (1615 credits)
- Since we don’t have enough Constitution to equip the Nerve Enhancement System, and only Sion and Traya use stunning force powers against us, we go for offensive items and this implant is the easiest guaranteed item we can access that gives us +2 STR.

*Head: Targeting Visor*
Obtained from dead mercenary in the Enclave Ruins
- The only guaranteed helmet we can obtain, this gives is a +1 to attack and +1 to reflex saves.  If you find other better helmets, prioritize equipping those over this helmet.

*Gloves: Sith Power Gauntlets*
Obtained from Sith Lord at Freedon Nadd’s Tomb
- This is used for the +3 Strength; which gives us a lot of damage and accuracy.

*Body: Ossus Keeper Robe OR Jal Shey's Armor*
Reward from Queen Talia during Onderon 2, Jal Shey's Armor obtained from Geeda
- At the beginning, we only have easy access to the Mining Outfit that gives us +1 defense.  
- We use the Jal Shey Armor (bought from Geeda) then for its defense and dexterity bonus.  
- Later on, we swap to the Ossus Keeper Robe for more force point pool, and for better resistance against Sion/Traya’s force powers.
- Beginners can opt to keep Jal Shey's Armor, as it provides more defense for the late game.

*Main Hand Weapon: Single Lightsaber*
Crafted by Bao-Dur after Dantooine
- We use a 1H Lightsaber for use with Critical Strikes later on.  At Nar Shaddaa, we will be buying two crystals for it:

Crystal 1: Nextor
Bought on Nar Shaddaa from Oondar for 3580 credits.
- Provides a high critical threat range, which makes our critical hits stronger. It also gives a nice +1 to our attack modifier.

Crystal 2: Opila
Bought on Nar Shaddaa from Geeda for 2831 credits
- Grants us the Keen effect, which gives us a 10% increased chance to crit. It also adds a flat +3 to damage, and is very cost effective.

*Off-hand Weapon: Freedon Nadd's Short Lightsaber*
Obtained from Freedon Nadd’s Tomb
- This is a very good off-hand weapon that increases our accuracy while having higher damage than other lightsabers.  Before that, we will be using a vibroblade, or a offhand lightsaber for damage.

*Belt: None, or best belt you looted*
- There are no good guaranteed belts we can purchase for an affordable price. See itemization below for things you are looking for in a belt.

*Shield Slots: Main Character's Armband/Energy Shield*
- Gives us +1 to Constitution, which gives us more HP.
- The Energy Shield is equipped to mitigate damage from blasters, which is primarily used at Peragus when walking through mines.

The majority of our equipment is attained in Nar Shaddaa, with the exception of the Ossus Keeper Robe.  For the early game, we will make use of a pair of vibroblades, though some exceptions are made depending on the weapons shops have.

*Item Prioritization*
- Due to the RNG nature of loot and shops in this game, sometimes there are better items you might find for the early game on the way.  You'll want to prioritize it roughly by:
1. +Strength: Strength gives us more damage AND more accuracy, and therefore is much more beneficial to us overall than any other stat.
2. +Damage (any type): More damage is great.  Generally this will be in the form of +physical damage (e.g Gamorrean Gloves).
3. +Attack: Gives us more chance of hitting, which is crucial early game since our weapons are weaker.
4. +Wisdom: Gives us better saving throws for the endgame, where Nihilus, Sion, and Traya use force powers against us.
5. +Defense:  Makes others less likely to hit us.  Nice stat, since we tend to run through areas with large amounts of enemies.

[section=Credits Route]

We do anywhere from 6-8 shopping trips during the run; the credit route branches depending on if you find better weapons to buy early game on Telos Station.  Our shopping is as follows:

*1. Samhan on Telos Station*
Sell: Droid Self-Sustaining Parts (3000), 1x Parts, 2x Vibroblade
Buy: 10x Alacrity, 8x Stamina, 8x Strength, 2x Ion Grenade, 1x Hyper Alacrity, 1x Hyper Stamina
	- You can buy any light/medium armor under 1,000 credits for Bao-Dur later (if you buy the Sith War Sword you can only afford the Combat Suit which is 50 credits)
	- You may also buy the Sith War Sword (~1780) OR Zabrak Vibroblade (1000) if it spawns here.  If buying either of these weapons, consider buying less medpacks, 2 less sets of Stamina/Strength stims, and sell 1 Vibrosword.

*2: Dendis on Telos Station*
Buy: Enough Medpacks to have 15-20 medpacks (depending on what you bought in the first shop)

*3. Adum Larp on Dantooine*
Sell: Benok's Blaster and Exchange Negotiator (+ any extra armor you bought except Mining Outfit)
Buy: 11x Battle Stims

*4. Kex on Dxun*
Buy: 9x Average Frag Mine, 2x Hyper Strength, 1x Hyper Battle Stim, 10x Alacrity, 7-8x Strength, 9-10x Stamina, 30-35 Advanced Medpacks

*5. Oondar on Nar Shaadaa*
Sell: Mandalorian Blaster, 1x Lightsaber (priortize selling double lightsaber over single handed lightsaber)
Buy: Nextor Crystal

*6. Geeda on Nar Shaadaa*
Buy: Power Implant, Jal Shey Armor, Opila Crystal (~4950 credits)
Sell: Anything but lightsabers/used items to attain a total of 2000 credits

Most of our credits come from quests that we do on the way, and a select few guarenteed items.  The credits route is a little tight, as we need a lot of money for crystals, medpacks, stims, and mines.

The quests we do to get money are as follows: 
1. We get the Atmospheric Sensors for Saedie, for 3000 credits since we can do this on the way to rescue Vrook from the mercenaries.
2. We allow Azkul to bribe us for an extra 1000 credits.  We can skip the battle here that normally gives us 4000 credits, so allowing Azkul to bribe us along with completing Saedie's quest makes up the credit loss.
3. We take the 1000 credit reward from Zuko, since we need all the extra money we can get.
4. We give our spare starport visa to Sakarie, who gives us 5000 credits in exchange.

The guarenteed items we sell are as follows:
1. Mandalorian Blaster Rifle.  This sells for 4400 at Kex or Oondar, but you can also sell it to 1B-8D for 1k more credits, at the cost of an extra sell menu.
2. Exchange Negotiator.  Obtained from Lexa and used to help fund our stim needs.
3. Benok's Blaster.  Sells for ~780 and is used to help fund stim needs.
4. Lightsaber (or double-sided lightsaber).  Sells for ~680 and is used to help bribe Kaalah-Nah.

[section=Alignment Route]

Alignment in KotOR is a sliding scale from 0 to 100, initialized at 50; higher numbers are Light, lower numbers are dark.  Shifts in alignment are determined by a matrix; every alignment-shifting action is classified as Light or Dark, and then assigned a level (either Low, Mid, or High).  The player character (The Exile) can either be aligned as Very Dark, Dark, Neutral, Light, or Very Light.  The more opposed your alignment and the action's classification, the more drastic your shift in alignment; for example, a Light-aligned character performing a High Dark action will have a large shift, while a Dark character performing a High Dark action will have a smaller shift.

Here is the alignment route used in the run:

https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/808151224842977353/812818832296116285/unknown.png

Alignment is not as important in this game, as we don’t use any equipment restricted by alignment. We do, however, stay on Light Side/Neutral in order to obtain Mira at Nar Shaddaa, as she is used for Goto’s ship segment to pass by the many deadly mines quickly without blowing them up, and to obtain deadly mines for Hanharr 2 later on at Malachor V.  

Other than obtaining Mira, most of our decisions are done with the intention of getting the fastest result, while gaining as many alignment shifts as possible so that we can spawn Visas.  

Getting Visas to spawn requires either 25/75 alignment (high dark/light, respectively), or 50 total alignment shifts.  We go for the 50 total alignment points, since it is much easier to attain while taking the most efficient path.  After attaining Visas, our alignment doesn't matter anymore.

[section=Route Overview]

The order in which we visit planets is as follows:

Peragus -> Telos -> Korriban -> Dantooine -> Dxun/Onderon 1 -> Nar Shaddaa -> Onderon 2 -> Ravager -> Malachor V

The reasoning for the middle planets:
- We do Korriban and Dantooine first, as there is little to no combat necessary until the end of Dantooine, and to obtain all the parts for the lightsaber as fast as possible.
- We do Dxun and Onderon 1 since we have a better weapon, and to unlock Geeda’s guaranteed wares that require Dantooine and Onderon 1 to be completed. 
- Nar Shaddaa is done last, as there are some combat intensive segments that require the use of frag mines (from Dxun) for Atton and Mira, and we want to do the prior planets to unlock Geeda’s upgraded wares, which is crucial for our build.

[section=Detailed Route]

This section will describe all the actions you'll need to take for the Glitchless Any% run.

Notation:
> indicates a level up to be done
} indicates an inventory/equipment action to be done
MC indicates the Main Character (aka you/The Exile)

Conversation Notes: 
If no conversation choices are specified, spamming will work (this chooses all 1 options).
A | indicates a break in the conversation.  You will have to talk to the person again.
A -> indicates a secondary part to the conversation.  This is different from -> in that the conversation automatically initiates, rather than having to talk to the same person.
A #xY indicates repeat that option Y times, as in HK-50's first conversation.
A #x- indicates the rest of this conversation uses that particular number, generally used to indicate conversation spam not using 1 (e.g Saedie's conversation)

*Optional: If a Sith War Sword OR Zabrak Vibroblade appears, buy it and sell 1 Vibrosword.  If buying the Sith War Sword, you may need to take 1 less Stamina/Strength and no frag grenades to make up for the increased amount of money spent.  Buying these weapons will make combat more consistent, but it is not worth resetting for those two weapons within the shop.  If you see suitable armor as well, you should take the weapon over armor. *

This guide assumes you stick with the two Vibroswords as your main weapon.

Run to Dendis and buy enough medpacks to have 20 total.

Ending Credits: Roughly around ~1200 max, to a low of 200.  This depends on whether or not you spent extra money to buy a upgraded weapon and/or armor.

Go inside the Cantina and talk to Luxa (1 spam)
Exit and transition back to the Czerka area: 2 2
Run to the Exchange building and 1 spam the person outside and the receptionist inside (DO NOT USE KREIA TO APPROACH HER).

Pseudo-stim up, use Force Speed/Valor, and press 6 to initiate the fight.
Afterwards, swap weapons (default key: H) to open the door (swap back to swords after) and talk to the gamorrean.  Kill the two droids.

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/808151224842977353/813292495361802260/unknown.png

Leave with Kreia and transition back to the Czerka area (2 2)

After talking to Chodo as MC, run and transition to the Docks (2 1).
1 spam through the cutscene, talk to the Ithorian, use the console twice, and leave the area.

** Telos Surface **

Mouse spam through the cutscene (1 spam).  Bring Kreia with you when promted.
Turn on solo mode and run MC through the entire area.  
In the next area turn solo mode on again, and run through the mines.  
Before the cutscene with the Twilek, pseudo-stim up.
Run past the Twilek, and use Force Valor before starting the fight: 4

- You want to kill the nonshielded people immediately and round up the shielded people together.  Then have everyone throw 1 ion grenade (use another as needed, though you want to keep 3 for later) to kill the last person.
- Afterwards, place Bao-Dur and Kreia away from the fight so they don’t attack any more people.  Take MC to the console and kill enemies around there. 
- Then click on it after battle (don’t spam until you see the cursor disappear else you have a high chance of skipping the cutscene which is considered a bug and makes your run invalid!)

Afterwards, turn on solo mode and run MC to the entrance of the Military Base

** Military Base**

* This is one of the most difficult segments, as Bao-Dur has a lot of chances to get stunned and lose a lot of time, so make your way through the area quick.  If he gets stunned, keep the energy shield and medpac going as needed. Beginners may want to make a manual save at the beginning*

*Try not to make too many manual saves, as there is a long fade-in when reloading saves and that will cause Bao-Dur to act on his own.  You may want to turn on Passive mode for him.*

Turn on solo mode, swap to Bao-Dur, and do the menu below:
	} Unequip Plasma Torch on MC, give Bao-Dur the best armor you have, Plasma Torch, and an Energy Shield.  

Use an Alacrity/Stamina stim on him, and turn on the energy shield.   After the first cutscene, take MC to a corner and swap back to Bao-Dur.

Run Bao-Dur through the base until the hangar.  There will be a cutscene that plays, IMMEDATELY pause after (1 1) and swap back to Bao-Dur.  
Then open the two doors to the side (open left, use the console, then open the right door and turn off Solo Mode to bring your party members over.  
Turn on Solo Mode once your party members teleport over and run through the next room again.

When transitioning to the next cutscene as MC, do NOT spam through it, or else you may get softlocked as the door will remain closed.

[section=Version History]

**v2.0 (Feburary 2021) **
- Massive reroute from 30's initial route to incorporate more consistent equipment strategies.  
- No longer relies on RNG shops on Telos/Dantooine, incorporate Geeda/Oondar's shop on Nar Shaddaa
- Alignment Reroute to get a total of 50 alignment points to spawn Visas, rather than 75 alignment to spawn Visas
- Used ChaosDrifter's calculator to analyze combat data to swap from Flurry build to Master Critical Strike build
- Now takes the DS option on Dantooine to skip a large combat segment.
- Changed taken characters on Freedon Nadd for better consistency.
- Skip grinding encounters on Dxun to only kill the neccessary enemies.
- Skip killing the thug group on Nar Shaddaa in exchange for the Geeda/Oondar sidequests.

** v1.0 **
